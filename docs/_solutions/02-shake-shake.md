In this mini solution, you will learn how to use accelerometer and gyroscope sensor to tigger an event using Azure Function: retrieving a random tweet with `#hashtag` you have customized in your Arduino code. The tweet will display on DevKit screen. Every time you shake your DevKit board, you will get a new tweet.

## Requirements

* Finish the [Getting Started Guide]({{"/docs/getting-started/" | absolute_url }}) to prepare your development environment and hardware.
* An active Azure account.

## Step.1 Open mini solution folder

In VS Code, use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to invoke command palette and type **Arduino** then find and select **Arduino: Examples** to open example pane:

![mini-solution-arduino-examples]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution-arduino-examples.png" | absolute_url }})

Find `Examples for MXChip AZ3166 > AzureIoTHub > AzureIoTHubExample`, click to open the solution in a new VS Code window:

![mini-solution-solution-catalog]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution-catalog.png" | absolute_url }})

## Step.2 Provision Azure services

In the solution window, run your task through **Quick Open** (`Ctrl+P`) by typing 'task', `Space` and command name. In this case, 'task provision':

![mini-solution-task-provision]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution-task-provision.png" | absolute_url }})

In terminal window, an interactive command line will guide you provision all Azure services that are required for this mini solution:

![mini-solution-provision-sub]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution-provision-sub.png" | absolute_url }})

You can also check [step by step tutorial for provision](/azure-iot-developer-kit/solutions/common/provision-step-by-step.html) to see more details.

## Step.3 Modify the code to retrieve tweet with #hashtag

Open `AzureIotHubExample.ino` and look for the line of code:

```cpp
iothub_client_sample_send_event((const unsigned char *)"{\"topic\":\"build2017\", \"DeviceID\":\"myDevice1\"}");
```

Replace `#iot` with your preferred hashtag want to retrieve a tweet from. How about `#build2017`:smile:?

## Step.4 Build and deploy your solution

Build and deploy Arduino code as well as [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/){:target="_blank"} to wire all things up together.

Use **Quick Open** (`Ctrl+P`) to run 'task deploy'. It will start deploying Azure Function code. Normally it takes 2 to 5 minutes to finish the deployment:

![mini-solution-deploy]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution-deploy.png" | absolute_url }})

Use again **Quick Open** (`Ctrl+P`) to run 'task build':

It will build Arduino code and deploy to the device. DevKit will reboot and start running the solution immediately after that:

![mini-solution-build]({{"/assets/images/mini-solution-build.png" | absolute_url }})

## Test the solution

After initialization of the app, click `Button A` and mildly shake the board to retrieve a random tweet with hashtag `build2017`. In a few seconds, it will display on screen:

{% include gallery id="layouts_gallery" caption="Shake, shake for a random tweet with `#hashtag` you set in the code." %}

You can press `Button A` again to shake for a new tweet. Cross the finger to get some inspirations from randoms!
